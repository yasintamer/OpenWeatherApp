# Open Weather App

## ToDo

If I spend more time then I would do these
1. I would use compose BackHandler to handle back navigation from look up screen
2. Show errors in snackbar
3. Show dialog before asking location permission to explain why I need location access and how I use
4. Cache the weather reponse and implement pull to refresh to refresh the current weather
5. List the most recent selected location in the look up page
6. Use kotlin dsl for gradle
